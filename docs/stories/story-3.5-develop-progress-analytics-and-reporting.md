# Story 3.5: Develop Progress Analytics and Reporting

As an administrator,
I want to view aggregate progress analytics across all projects,
so that I can identify systemic issues and optimize the program.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Real-time dashboard shows: total projects, completion rates, average progress
2: Drill-down by department, advisor, project type, or student cohort
3: Trend analysis shows progress patterns over time
4: Bottleneck identification highlights common delay points
5: Export functionality for charts and raw data (Excel, PDF)
6: Scheduled reports automatically generated and emailed
7: Predictive analytics estimate project completion likelihood
