# Story 1.2: Implement Database Schema and Migrations

As a backend developer,
I want to establish the core database schema with migration tools,
so that we can evolve the database structure safely over time.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: PostgreSQL database schema created for users, roles, and authentication tables
2: Database migration tool (Prisma/TypeORM) configured and initial migration created
3: Seed data scripts created for development and testing environments
4: Database connection pooling and monitoring configured
5: Indexes created for frequent query patterns (email, student_id lookups)
6: Backup and restoration procedures documented and tested
