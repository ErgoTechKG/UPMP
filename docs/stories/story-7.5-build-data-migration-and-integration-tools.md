# Story 7.5: Build Data Migration and Integration Tools

As a system administrator,
I want tools to migrate data from legacy systems,
so that we can preserve historical information.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Migration wizards for common data types (users, projects, grades)
2: Data mapping interface to match old fields to new
3: Validation rules ensure data integrity
4: Incremental migration supports phased transitions
5: Rollback procedures for failed migrations
6: API endpoints for ongoing synchronization
7: Migration status dashboard with progress tracking
