# Story 3.4: Implement Automated Progress Monitoring

As a research secretary,
I want the system to automatically track and flag at-risk projects,
so that I can intervene before projects fail.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Dashboard shows all projects with visual status indicators (green/yellow/red)
2: Automatic status calculation based on: submission timeliness, approval status
3: Configurable thresholds for yellow (warning) and red (critical) status
4: Email/WeChat alerts sent for status changes to secretary
5: At-risk report generated weekly with intervention recommendations
6: Manual status override with required justification
7: Historical status tracking for pattern analysis
