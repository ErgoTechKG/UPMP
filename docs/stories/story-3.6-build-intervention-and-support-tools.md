3: Intervention templates for common issues (time management, technical difficulties)
4: Meeting scheduler integrated with calendar systems
5: Outcome tracking: successful/unsuccessful intervention
6: Intervention history visible on student and project profiles
7: Success metrics dashboard for intervention effectiveness
