# Story 2.5: Build AI-Powered Matching Algorithm

As a platform administrator,
I want the system to intelligently match students with suitable projects,
so that both parties have higher satisfaction with matches.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Algorithm analyzes student interests, skills, and past performance
2: Project requirements matched against student qualifications
3: Matching score (0-100) calculated for each student-project pair
4: Professor can sort applicants by match score
5: Students see "Recommended for you" projects based on their profile
6: Algorithm performance tracked through acceptance rates and satisfaction scores
7: Manual override allows admins to adjust matching weights
