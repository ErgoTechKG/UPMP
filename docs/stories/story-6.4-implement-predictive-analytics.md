# Story 6.4: Implement Predictive Analytics

As a research secretary,
I want predictive models to identify at-risk projects early,
so that we can intervene proactively.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: ML model trained on historical project data
2: Risk scores calculated for active projects (0-100)
3: Factors contributing to risk score displayed
4: Accuracy metrics show model performance
5: Weekly alerts for projects crossing risk thresholds
6: Intervention recommendation engine suggests actions
7: Model retraining pipeline for continuous improvement
