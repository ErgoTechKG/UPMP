# Story 1.3: Build Multi-Method Authentication Service

As a student or professor,
I want to register and login using multiple methods (student ID, email, WeChat Work),
so that I can access the platform using my preferred credentials.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Registration API endpoints support student ID, email, phone, and WeChat Work
2: Email/SMS verification flow implemented with token expiration
3: Login supports all registration methods with consistent JWT token response
4: Password requirements enforced (minimum 8 characters, complexity rules)
5: WeChat Work OAuth integration completed with proper error handling
6: Account linking allows users to connect multiple authentication methods
7: Bilingual (Chinese/English) error messages for all authentication scenarios
