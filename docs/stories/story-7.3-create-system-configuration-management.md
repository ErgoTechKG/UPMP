# Story 7.3: Create System Configuration Management

As a system administrator,
I want to configure system parameters without code deployment,
so that we can adapt to changing requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Configuration UI for: milestones, notifications, thresholds
2: Department-specific settings override global defaults
3: Feature flags enable gradual rollout of new features
4: Configuration change history with rollback
5: Test mode to preview configuration impact
6: Import/export configurations for backup
7: Access control for configuration changes
