# Story 5.3: Develop Feedback and Rating System

As a student,
I want to receive and provide feedback on courses and advisors,
so that the program continuously improves based on participant input.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Anonymous course evaluation forms with Likert scale questions
2: Custom questions configurable per course/semester
3: Mandatory evaluations block access until completed
4: Advisor feedback separate from course feedback
5: Aggregate ratings displayed publicly (individual responses private)
6: Sentiment analysis on text feedback identifies common themes
7: Response rate tracking and reminder system
