# Story 1.1: Initialize Project Infrastructure

As a DevOps engineer,
I want to set up the foundational project structure with CI/CD pipelines,
so that the team can develop and deploy features consistently and reliably.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Monorepo structure created with /apps, /packages, and /infrastructure directories
2: Git repository initialized with branch protection rules and PR templates  
3: CI/CD pipelines configured for automated testing and deployment using GitHub Actions/GitLab CI
4: Docker configurations created for local development environment
5: Basic health check endpoint returning system status at /api/health
6: Development, staging, and production environment configurations established
7: README with setup instructions and architecture documentation completed
