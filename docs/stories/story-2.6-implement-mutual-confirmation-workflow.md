# Story 2.6: Implement Mutual Confirmation Workflow

As a student and professor,
I want to confirm our mutual interest before finalizing the project assignment,
so that both parties are committed to the collaboration.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Professor sends offer to selected students with optional message
2: Students receive notification and have 72 hours to respond
3: Accept/decline interface with reason collection for declining
4: Waitlist functionality for backup candidates
5: Automatic notifications to waitlisted students when spots open
6: Final confirmation generates project assignment record
7: Both parties receive confirmation with next steps information
