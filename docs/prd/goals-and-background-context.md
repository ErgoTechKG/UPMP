# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable efficient student-advisor matching through AI-powered recommendations to increase successful research partnerships by 85%
- Automate research project tracking and reporting to reduce administrative overhead by 40% within the first year
- Provide structured research methodology training to achieve 95% student competency in core research skills
- Create real-time visibility into project progress enabling interventions for at-risk projects within 1 week
- Support dual-track programs (Qiming and Innovation classes) with configurable workflows and differentiated requirements
- Generate comprehensive data analytics to demonstrate program effectiveness for funding and accreditation purposes
- Achieve 90% on-time submission rate for all required research deliverables through automated reminders and clear milestone tracking

## Background Context

The Scientific Research Management Platform (SRMP) addresses critical inefficiencies in managing elite research education programs at Chinese universities. Currently, professors struggle with time-consuming manual processes for identifying promising students, while students lack systematic guidance for developing research skills. Research secretaries operate with fragmented data across multiple systems, making it impossible to proactively support struggling projects. This results in high dropout rates, lost research opportunities, and inability to scale programs effectively.

SRMP solves these problems by creating a centralized, role-based platform that automates workflows, provides intelligent matching between students and advisors, and delivers real-time insights into research progress. The platform specifically supports the unique requirements of Qiming (启明班) and Innovation (创新班) programs, incorporating structured research methodology training with project management tools. By following a "three-step operation" principle and providing bilingual support, SRMP ensures high adoption rates while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse research disciplines.
