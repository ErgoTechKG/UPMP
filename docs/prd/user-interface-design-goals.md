# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Create an intuitive, role-optimized interface that minimizes cognitive load while maximizing productivity. The design should reflect academic professionalism while remaining approachable for undergraduate students. Following the "three-step operation" principle, every major workflow should be completable within three user actions, with clear visual feedback at each step.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show only relevant information and options based on user role and current context
- **Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step wizards for complex processes like project matching and report submission
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on form inputs and file uploads to prevent errors
- **Bulk Actions**: Checkbox selection patterns for administrative batch operations
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Intuitive file uploads and student assignment interfaces
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-populate forms with intelligent suggestions based on user history and role

## Core Screens and Views

- Student Dashboard (个人主页)
- Project Discovery & Application (项目发现与申请)
- My Projects & Progress Tracker (我的项目)
- Research Methodology Learning Center (科研方法学习中心)
- Professor Dashboard (导师工作台)
- Project Posting & Management (项目发布管理)
- Student Applications Review (学生申请审核)
- Progress Monitoring & Feedback (进度监控与反馈)
- Admin Analytics Dashboard (管理分析面板)
- User Management Interface (用户管理)
- System Configuration Panel (系统配置)
- Batch Operations Center (批量操作中心)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform must meet WCAG AA standards including proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and clear focus indicators. All interactive elements must be properly labeled for assistive technologies.

## Branding

The design should reflect the academic excellence and innovation focus of elite Chinese universities. Use a professional color palette with blue as primary color representing trust and intelligence, complemented by green for success states and amber for warnings. Typography should prioritize readability with clear hierarchy using system fonts for optimal rendering across devices.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary target is desktop browsers (1366x768 and above) with responsive adaptation for tablets. Mobile phone access should be functional but optimized for quick status checks and notifications rather than complex workflows. Native mobile apps are out of scope for MVP.
