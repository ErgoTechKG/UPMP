# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Please review this PRD for the Scientific Research Management Platform (SRMP) and create comprehensive UI/UX specifications. Focus on designing intuitive workflows that follow the "three-step operation" principle, create role-specific interfaces that minimize cognitive load, and ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance. Pay special attention to the student-professor matching flow and progress tracking visualizations.

## Architect Prompt

Please create a detailed technical architecture for the Scientific Research Management Platform (SRMP) based on this PRD. Design a scalable microservices architecture within a monorepo structure, specify the API contracts between services, plan the database schema with proper normalization, and detail the integration approach for WeChat Work and university systems. Ensure the architecture supports 10,000 concurrent users and complies with Chinese data residency requirements.
