4: Expected commitment level specified (hours/week, duration)
5: Maximum student capacity can be set (1-10 students)
6: Save as draft functionality allows incremental completion
7: Preview mode shows how project will appear to students
8: Bilingual support for project content (optional English translation)

## Story 2.2: Build Project Discovery and Search

As a student,
I want to browse and search available research projects,
so that I can find opportunities matching my interests and skills.

### Acceptance Criteria

2: Search functionality includes title, description, professor name, and tags
3: Filters available for: department, commitment level, prerequisites
4: Sort options include: newest, deadline approaching, best match
5: Project cards show key information: title, professor, brief description, applicants
6: Saved projects feature allows bookmarking interesting opportunities
7: Project detail page displays complete information and application status

## Story 2.3: Implement Student Application System

As a student,
I want to apply to research projects with my CV and statement,
so that professors can evaluate my qualifications.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Application form includes CV upload (PDF/DOC, max 5MB) and motivation statement
2: Character limit (500-1000) enforced for motivation statement
3: Previous research experience can be highlighted from profile
4: Application tracking shows status: draft, submitted, under review, accepted/rejected
5: Students can withdraw applications before professor review
6: Maximum concurrent applications limit enforced (e.g., 5 active applications)
7: Confirmation email/notification sent upon successful submission

## Story 2.4: Develop Professor Application Review Interface

As a professor,
I want to review and evaluate student applications efficiently,
so that I can select the most suitable candidates for my research projects.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Application inbox shows pending applications with count badges
2: Batch view displays student summary cards with key qualifications
3: Detailed view shows full application, CV preview, and academic records
4: Quick actions: accept, reject, request more information
5: Comparison mode allows side-by-side evaluation of multiple candidates
6: Notes field for recording evaluation thoughts (private to professor)
7: Bulk actions enable rejecting multiple applications with template message

## Story 2.5: Build AI-Powered Matching Algorithm

As a platform administrator,
I want the system to intelligently match students with suitable projects,
so that both parties have higher satisfaction with matches.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Algorithm analyzes student interests, skills, and past performance
2: Project requirements matched against student qualifications
3: Matching score (0-100) calculated for each student-project pair
4: Professor can sort applicants by match score
5: Students see "Recommended for you" projects based on their profile
6: Algorithm performance tracked through acceptance rates and satisfaction scores
7: Manual override allows admins to adjust matching weights

## Story 2.6: Implement Mutual Confirmation Workflow

As a student and professor,
I want to confirm our mutual interest before finalizing the project assignment,
so that both parties are committed to the collaboration.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Professor sends offer to selected students with optional message
2: Students receive notification and have 72 hours to respond
3: Accept/decline interface with reason collection for declining
4: Waitlist functionality for backup candidates
5: Automatic notifications to waitlisted students when spots open
6: Final confirmation generates project assignment record
7: Both parties receive confirmation with next steps information
