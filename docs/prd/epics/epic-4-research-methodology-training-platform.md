# Epic 4: Research Methodology Training Platform

Build a comprehensive self-paced learning system that teaches essential research skills through interactive modules with assessment and certification.

## Story 4.1: Create Course Structure and Content Management

As a curriculum designer,
I want to organize research methodology content into structured modules,
so that students progress logically through the material.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: 12-step methodology framework implemented as sequential modules
2: Each module contains: video lectures, reading materials, exercises
3: Content management system allows updating materials without code changes
4: Prerequisites enforced between modules
5: Estimated completion time displayed for each module
6: Progress tracking shows completion percentage
7: Mobile-responsive design for learning on any device

## Story 4.2: Develop Interactive Learning Components

As a student,
I want to engage with interactive exercises and examples,
so that I can better understand and apply research concepts.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Interactive quizzes with immediate feedback after each module
2: Case study simulations for research design decisions
3: Code playground for data analysis tutorials (R/Python)
4: Peer review exercises for research proposal writing
5: Glossary of terms with hover definitions throughout content
6: Bookmark feature to save important concepts
7: Note-taking capability within the learning interface

## Story 4.3: Implement Assessment and Certification System

As a student,
I want to complete assessments and earn certificates,
so that I can demonstrate my research methodology competence.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Module assessments require 80% score to proceed
2: Comprehensive final exam covering all 12 steps
3: Multiple attempt allowed with different question sets
4: Time limits enforced for assessments (e.g., 60 minutes)
5: Digital certificate generated upon successful completion
6: Certificate includes completion date and unique verification code
7: Public verification page to confirm certificate authenticity

## Story 4.4: Build Progress Tracking and Gamification

As a student,
I want to see my learning progress and earn achievements,
so that I stay motivated to complete the training.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Visual progress bar shows overall and per-module completion
2: Achievement badges for: fast completion, perfect scores, helping peers
3: Leaderboard (optional participation) shows top learners
4: Study streak tracking encourages consistent engagement
5: Estimated time to completion based on current pace
6: Weekly email summaries of progress and suggestions
7: Social sharing of achievements and certificates

## Story 4.5: Create Instructor Dashboard and Analytics

As a program administrator,
I want to monitor student progress through the training program,
so that I can identify those needing additional support.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Dashboard shows enrollment numbers and completion rates
2: Individual student progress tracking with last activity date
3: Average scores by module identify difficult content
4: Time-to-completion analytics by student cohort
5: Dropout analysis shows where students commonly stop
6: Export class reports for academic records
7: Bulk enrollment tools for new student cohorts
