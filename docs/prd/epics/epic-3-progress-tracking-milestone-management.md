# Epic 3: Progress Tracking & Milestone Management

Create a comprehensive system for tracking research progress through standardized milestones with automated monitoring and interventions for at-risk projects.

## Story 3.1: Design Milestone Framework and Templates

As a research secretary,
I want to configure standardized research milestones,
so that all projects follow consistent progress checkpoints.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Default milestone templates created: Literature Review, Proposal, Experimentation, Interim, Final
2: Milestones include expected duration, deliverables, and evaluation criteria
3: Admin interface allows creating custom milestone templates
4: Templates can be assigned based on project type or department
5: Each milestone has configurable reminder schedule
6: Dependencies between milestones can be specified
7: Milestone templates support bilingual names and descriptions

## Story 3.2: Build Progress Submission Interface

As a student,
I want to submit progress updates and deliverables for each milestone,
so that my advisor can track my research advancement.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Progress form adapts based on current milestone requirements
2: File upload supports multiple formats (PDF, DOC, ZIP) with version control
3: Structured fields capture: work completed, challenges, next steps
4: Research journal entry linked to progress submission
5: Save draft functionality allows incremental updates
6: Submission triggers notification to advisor
7: Previous submissions viewable in chronological history

## Story 3.3: Create Advisor Review and Feedback System

As a professor,
I want to review student progress and provide structured feedback,
so that students receive timely guidance on their research.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Review queue shows pending submissions sorted by deadline
2: Inline commenting on uploaded documents (PDF annotation)
3: Structured feedback form: strengths, improvements, next steps
4: Approval status options: approved, needs revision, at-risk
5: Feedback triggers notification to student
6: Historical feedback accessible for context
7: Batch approval for simple progress confirmations

## Story 3.4: Implement Automated Progress Monitoring

As a research secretary,
I want the system to automatically track and flag at-risk projects,
so that I can intervene before projects fail.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Dashboard shows all projects with visual status indicators (green/yellow/red)
2: Automatic status calculation based on: submission timeliness, approval status
3: Configurable thresholds for yellow (warning) and red (critical) status
4: Email/WeChat alerts sent for status changes to secretary
5: At-risk report generated weekly with intervention recommendations
6: Manual status override with required justification
7: Historical status tracking for pattern analysis

## Story 3.5: Develop Progress Analytics and Reporting

As an administrator,
I want to view aggregate progress analytics across all projects,
so that I can identify systemic issues and optimize the program.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Real-time dashboard shows: total projects, completion rates, average progress
2: Drill-down by department, advisor, project type, or student cohort
3: Trend analysis shows progress patterns over time
4: Bottleneck identification highlights common delay points
5: Export functionality for charts and raw data (Excel, PDF)
6: Scheduled reports automatically generated and emailed
7: Predictive analytics estimate project completion likelihood

## Story 3.6: Build Intervention and Support Tools

As a research secretary,
I want to efficiently manage interventions for struggling students,
so that we can improve project success rates.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Intervention workflow: flag project → assign support → track outcome
2: Support ticket system links to specific projects and students
3: Intervention templates for common issues (time management, technical difficulties)
4: Meeting scheduler integrated with calendar systems
5: Outcome tracking: successful/unsuccessful intervention
6: Intervention history visible on student and project profiles
7: Success metrics dashboard for intervention effectiveness
