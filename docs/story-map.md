    S1.2 --> S7.5[Story 7.5: Data Migration]
```

### External Service Dependencies
1. **WeChat Work API** (Story 1.3, 5.1) - Registration required 2-3 weeks in advance
2. **University SSO** (Story 1.3) - Integration specifications needed
3. **Alibaba Cloud Services** (Story 1.1) - Account setup required
4. **Email/SMS Gateway** (Story 1.3, 5.1) - Vendor selection needed

### Data Dependencies
- Story 1.2 (Database Schema) blocks ALL data-related stories
- Story 1.4 (RBAC) blocks ALL role-specific features
- Story 3.1 (Milestone Framework) blocks progress tracking stories

### UI Dependencies
- Story 1.6 (UI Shell) blocks ALL frontend development
- Frontend framework selection impacts all UI stories

## Risk Mitigation Sequencing

### High-Risk Items to Address Early
1. **WeChat Work Integration** - Start registration in Sprint 1
2. **AI Matching Algorithm** - Spike in Sprint 2, simplify if needed
3. **Database Schema** - Complete design before Sprint 2
4. **Third-party Integrations** - Create mocks in Sprint 1

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Sprint 1: Infrastructure setup + WeChat registration + Mock services
- Sprint 2: Database + Redis/Elasticsearch setup
- Sprint 4: RBAC implementation + User profile management
- Sprint 5: UI development + Documentation + Testing

## MVP Critical Path

The following stories form the critical path for MVP delivery:

1. Story 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.6 (Foundation)
2. Story 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4 (Basic Project Matching)
3. Story 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 (Basic Progress Tracking)
4. Story 5.1 (Notifications)

Total MVP: ~15 stories delivering core functionality

## Post-MVP Prioritization

Based on value and complexity:

### Phase 2 (High Value, Lower Complexity)
- Epic 4: Research Methodology Training
- Story 2.5: AI Matching (if not in MVP)
- Story 3.4-3.5: Advanced Progress Analytics

### Phase 3 (High Value, Higher Complexity)
- Epic 6: Full Analytics Platform
- Epic 7: Advanced Admin Tools
- Story 5.4: Calendar Integration

## File Locations

- **Epics**: `/docs/prd/epics/` directory (8 files including epic-list.md)
- **Stories**: `/docs/stories/` directory (38 files)
- **PRD Sections**: `/docs/prd/` directory (15 files)
- **Architecture Sections**: `/docs/architecture/` directory (21 files)

## Usage Instructions

1. **For Sprint Planning**: Use stories in `/docs/stories/` as ready-to-implement work items
2. **For Development**: Each story file contains complete acceptance criteria
3. **For Dependencies**: Check this map before starting any story
4. **For Risk Management**: Prioritize high-risk dependencies early

## Maintenance

This story map should be updated when:
- New dependencies are discovered
- Story estimates change significantly
- External dependencies change
- Sprint allocation needs adjustment
