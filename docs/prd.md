### Background Context

The Scientific Research Management Platform (SRMP) addresses critical inefficiencies in managing elite research education programs at Chinese universities. Currently, professors struggle with time-consuming manual processes for identifying promising students, while students lack systematic guidance for developing research skills. Research secretaries operate with fragmented data across multiple systems, making it impossible to proactively support struggling projects. This results in high dropout rates, lost research opportunities, and inability to scale programs effectively.

SRMP solves these problems by creating a centralized, role-based platform that automates workflows, provides intelligent matching between students and advisors, and delivers real-time insights into research progress. The platform specifically supports the unique requirements of Qiming (启明班) and Innovation (创新班) programs, incorporating structured research methodology training with project management tools. By following a "three-step operation" principle and providing bilingual support, SRMP ensures high adoption rates while maintaining the flexibility needed for diverse research disciplines.

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Please review this PRD for the Scientific Research Management Platform (SRMP) and create comprehensive UI/UX specifications. Focus on designing intuitive workflows that follow the "three-step operation" principle, create role-specific interfaces that minimize cognitive load, and ensure WCAG AA accessibility compliance. Pay special attention to the student-professor matching flow and progress tracking visualizations.

### Architect Prompt

Please create a detailed technical architecture for the Scientific Research Management Platform (SRMP) based on this PRD. Design a scalable microservices architecture within a monorepo structure, specify the API contracts between services, plan the database schema with proper normalization, and detail the integration approach for WeChat Work and university systems. Ensure the architecture supports 10,000 concurrent users and complies with Chinese data residency requirements.
